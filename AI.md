#### ww-stack

***Description***: A draggable and sortable stack component based on vuedraggable that manages collections of items with reordering capabilities.

***Specifications***:
- Built using vuedraggable for drag-and-drop functionality
- IMPORTANT: Contents are structured with header, item, and footer sections
- Uses internal tracking of dragging state with the `isDragging` variable
- Can be set to readonly mode to disable drag-and-drop functionality
- Maintains item grouping for drag-and-drop between different stacks with the same group

***Properties***:
- **readonly**: Boolean to make the stack read-only (disables drag functionality). Default: false
- **itemKey**: String that specifies the property to use as unique key for items. Default: "id"

***Layout Elements***:
- **headerElement**: Elements to display at the top of the stack
- **itemElement**: Template for each item in the stack (receives item data and index)
- **footerElement**: Elements to display at the bottom of the stack

***Events***:
- **item:moved**: Triggered when an item is moved within the stack. Event data includes:
  - item: The moved item
  - oldIndex: Index before moving
  - newIndex: Index after moving
  - updatedList: Full updated list after the move
- **item:added**: Triggered when an item is added to the stack. Event data includes:
  - item: The added item
  - newIndex: Index where item was added
  - updatedList: Full updated list after addition
- **item:removed**: Triggered when an item is removed from the stack. Event data includes:
  - item: The removed item
  - oldIndex: Index from which item was removed
  - updatedList: Full updated list after removal

***States***:
- **readonly**: Applied when the stack is in readonly mode (can't reorder items)
- **isDragging**: Boolean variable that tracks if dragging is in progress

***Children***:
- **itemElement**: The template for each item in the stack.
- **headerElement**: Content displayed at the top of the stack.
- **footerElement**: Content displayed at the bottom of the stack.

***Notes***:
- The component fixes pointer events for proper touch dragging on mobile/tablet
